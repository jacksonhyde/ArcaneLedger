> The rosy-cheeked halfling launches into his sales pitch as the curious wagon grinds to a halt, his well-rehearsed patter punctuated with impromptu hiccups.

> "Never have I seen such a thirsty bunch of **_hic_** travellers! Friends, you are in lu- **_hic_** luck, Arno the Travelling Sommelier is here to answer the prayers of the **_hic_** parched."

> He hops down from the footboard, swinging on a lever protruding from the cabin. The bulbous exterior of the wagon unfolds like a mechanical flower, revealing a complex instrument of copper and glass: it appears to be an alchemical still. A music box crawls to life, and the merry polka synchronises with the pops and gurgles of effervescent liquids swirling within.

> As if from nowhere he produces a tray of small glasses and strides over to one of the many taps protruding from the contraption. A subtle cinnamon aroma dances on the breeze as he fills the glasses with a clear syrup. He winks and drinks down one of the glasses with a theatrical flourish.

> “Arno’s Spring Dew - just the stuff to soothe a **_hic_** dusty gullet. Guaranteed satisfaction and a pleasant disposition to boot! Come fr- **_hic_** friends, try a sample of my many libations, a gift from me to you!”

## Arno the Travelling Sommelier

Arno is a potion salesman of suspect ability. Each of his concoctions are seemingly benign, granting some trivial boon for a short space of time. However, despite Arno’s best intentions his customers will invariably develop unwanted side effects, typically at odds with the desired effect

While these side effects are never permanent, disgruntled customers are often denied recompense - Arno has moved on to the next town. Naturally, Arno does not advertise the delayed effects, and will deny any such allegations with gusto.

## Potion Effects

Each of Arno’s potions have two effects. An initial effect and a delayed side effect. When a potion is consumed roll a d3. The result determines how many hours the initial result lasts, but also how many days until the delayed side effects begin to manifest. Delayed side effects last for _twice_ the duration of the initial effect.

A roll of 3 would mean the initial effects last 3 hours, with side effects manifesting 3 days after consuming the potion. The side effects would last for 6 hours.

## Potions

While ingenious, Arno’s Still is far from reliable. Bemused patron’s will often be pitched ‘alternatives’ before Arno manages to coax the correct order from the device. There are no prices on his menu; he prefers to appraise the affluence of his patrons before his proposes a transaction. He is flexible on price and will often offer discounts for bulk purchases. Arno may offer small samples of his potions. These samples are too small to manifest side effects, but do convey a momentary taste of the initial effects.

## Tracking Arno

Arno has made many enemies over the years, out of necessity he has mastered the art of evasion. Should a group of travellers be unfortunate enough to fall foul of Arno’s chicanery, they will struggle to track him down.

Once his customers are out of sight, Arno will feed his mules a dram of Stallion Reserve, driving his wagon to preternatural speeds as he flees the scene of the crime. By the time his customers realise they have been duped, Arno will be many leagues away.

Only the most tenacious of trackers will be able to close the distance. Typically, anyone following in Arno’s footsteps will encounter more of his victims, each suffering from some embarrassing ailment, each as incensed as the last. Offered a chance at revenge, these disgruntled patrons will frequently join the hunt, forming an angry mob of the curiously afflicted. The mob rarely succeeds in catching Arno, normally losing steam and dispersing once the side effects have worn off.

If captured, Arno will try to placate his accusers with free samples, using obsequious slick talk to avoid violent confrontation. If violence is unavoidable, Arno will quickly quaff his most powerful potion - a violent concoction that enlarges his physical size to over 20ft tall. In this form Arno is a dangerous foe, however, even his personal stash is suspect. Within minutes of drinking the potion Arno shrinks down to just a few inches, a side effect he will have to endure for at least a week - if he can survive that long.
